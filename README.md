# 💫 About Me:
Current Work<br><br>Right now, I’m working on a few projects that keep me curious and constantly learning. Percius is my web scraper which is used to visualize statistics. Resto Mania Backend is all about creating a solid and efficient restaurant management system. And Trip Planner lets me experiment with data and user experience through a smart navigation and travel management app. Each of these projects helps me explore new tools and sharpen my development skills.<br><br>Collaboration<br><br>I love teaming up with other developers, whether it’s for open-source, private, or experimental projects. I’m open to any kind of app or website idea — if it’s interesting and involves solving real problems, I’m in. Collaboration, for me, is one of the best ways to learn and grow as a developer.<br><br>Ask Me About<br><br>Feel free to ask me anything about Operating Systems, Programming, or Computer Hardware. I really enjoy understanding how systems work behind the scenes and how hardware and software interact to make things run efficiently.<br><br>Currently Learning<br><br>I’m currently diving deep into Software engineering concepts and models , AI/ML concepts and models, and Operating Systems. I’m also spending time learning different Databases (both SQL and NoSQL) and brushing up on Statistics and Mathematics that support machine learning and data analysis. I like exploring how all these areas connect in real-world applications.<br><br>Help Me With<br><br>I’m always looking to improve — especially when it comes to contributing to open-source projects, implementing AI/ML ideas in practical ways, and learning about deployment and maintenance of software systems. Any feedback or guidance in these areas is always welcome.<br><br>Fun Fact<br><br>I’m fascinated and obsessed with crazy optimizations and new ideas — whether it’s improving a few milliseconds of performance or rethinking how a system could work. I enjoy experimenting and finding unconventional ways to make technology more efficient and exciting.
