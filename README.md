# 💫 About Me:
Current Work<br><br>I am currently working on several diverse and engaging projects that showcase my technical versatility and curiosity. My ongoing projects include Percius, a web scraper and processing solution for another project ; Resto Mania Backend, which powers a complete restaurant management solution with efficient data handling and scalability in mind; and Trip Planner, a travel planning and recommendation system that is easy to use for users. Each project reflects my drive to explore different facets of computer technology — from backend systems to user experience optimization — and to continuously refine my problem-solving and software development skills.<br><br>Collaboration<br><br>I’m open to collaborating on any kind of application or website project — whether private, open-source, or experimental. What excites me most is the opportunity to learn from others, share ideas, and contribute to building meaningful, efficient, and creative solutions. I believe collaboration fuels innovation, and I’m always eager to be part of projects where I can apply my knowledge while also gaining new perspectives from other developers and engineers.<br><br>Ask Me About<br><br>I’m passionate about discussing topics related to Operating Systems, Programming, and Computer Hardware. I enjoy exploring the inner workings of systems, optimizing performance, and understanding how hardware and software interact at a low level. Whether it’s process scheduling, memory management, or writing efficient code, I love diving deep into how computing systems operate and evolve.<br><br>Currently Learning<br><br>I am currently expanding my knowledge across several key areas of computer science and engineering. My focus includes Software Engineering principles, AI/ML concepts, Operating Systems, and various Database Management Systems — both SQL and NoSQL. I’m also deepening my understanding of Statistics and Mathematics, as they form the analytical foundation for AI and data-driven development. This continuous learning helps me stay adaptable and ready to tackle complex, real-world technical challenges.<br><br>Help Me With<br><br>I’m always looking to improve the quality and impact of my work. I’d appreciate help and insights related to enhancing open-source contributions, implementing AI/ML concepts effectively, and mastering the deployment and maintenance of production-grade systems. Learning from experienced developers and real-world projects helps me strengthen my development practices and engineering mindset.<br><br>Fun Fact<br><br>I have a deep fascination with optimization and innovation — whether in hardware or software. I often find myself experimenting with unconventional ideas or tweaking systems to extract better performance. My curiosity about how things work and how they can work better drives much of my creativity and enthusiasm for technology.
